<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This page provides <em><strong>supplementary material</strong></em> of quasar properties presented in Rakshit et al. (2020). We present measurements of the spectral properties for a total of about 500,000 quasars selected from the fourteenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR14) quasar catalog. We performed a careful and homogeneous analysis of the SDSS spectra of these sources, to estimate the continuum and line properties of several emission lines such as Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Mg ii, C iii], C iv and Lyα. From the derived emission line parameters, we estimated single-epoch virial black hole masses (MBH) for the sample using Hβ, Mg ii and C iv emission lines. The sample covers a wide range in bolometric luminosity (logLbol; erg s−1) between 44.4 and 47.3 and logMBH between 7.1 and 9.9 M⊙. </font></p>

The 20, 40, 68 and 95 percentile density contours along with density maps are shown. The redshift and bolometric luminosity distributions are also shown for the DR14 quasars sample (empty histogram, this work) along with DR7 quasars (filled histogram, S11). A large number of high redshift and low luminous quasars were targeted by DR14 compared to DR7.</figcaption></figure>
