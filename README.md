<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This page provides <em><strong>supplementary material</strong></em> of quasar properties presented in Rakshit et al. (2020). We present measurements of the spectral properties for a total of about 500,000 quasars selected from the fourteenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR14) quasar catalog. We performed a careful and homogeneous analysis of the SDSS spectra of these sources, to estimate the continuum and line properties of several emission lines such as Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Mg ii, C iii], C iv and Lyα. From the derived emission line parameters, we estimated single-epoch virial black hole masses (MBH) for the sample using Hβ, Mg ii and C iv emission lines. The sample covers a wide range in bolometric luminosity (logLbol; erg s−1) between 44.4 and 47.3 and logMBH between 7.1 and 9.9 M⊙. </font></p>
